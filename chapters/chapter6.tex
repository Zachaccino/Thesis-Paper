\section{Aim}

Verifying the the proposed system is working well with real devices on a small scale.

\section{Setup}

The experimental setup is documented in the figure \ref{fig:sensing}. In summary, the solar panel generates electricity, measured by the input sensor, and fed into the converter. After converting to the desired voltage, the electricity is measured by the output sensor and stored in the battery. 


\section{Procedures}

The input and output sensor generates data in the form of analog signals and it is read by the microcontroller. A sim card with a 4G data plan is inserted into the microcontroller and the modem is connected to the microcontroller through the mini-PCIe slot.
