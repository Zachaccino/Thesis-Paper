\section{Concept}


\subsection{Monitoring}
The solar panel generates electricity and feeds it into the converter after being measured by the current and voltage sensor. The converter converts the electricity from a higher voltage to the desired voltage, which can be measured again by the sensor and used to charge the battery. The sensing data consist of input current and voltage and output current and voltage, which are fed into the microcontroller. The microcontroller has a 4G cellular modem which enables communication with the surrounding 4G cellular base station, and the internet access is provided by the gateway at the base station. That means the sensing data can be sent from the microcontroller to the server through the 4G cellular network. Once the sensing data reaches the server, the data is processed, store into the database, and send to the client such as a web application. The concept for monitoring is shown in figure \ref{fig:concept1}.

\subsection{Controlling}
The lifecycle of command begins at the client-initiated by the user. The command can be anything from setting the output voltage, to shutting down the converter. Once initiated, the client contacts the server to let it know a command had been issued, and the server store it in the database.

On the other hand, the microcontroller performs periodic polling, that is, querying the server if there are new commands issued by the user every second. Similar to the monitoring, the query that is sent from the microcontroller to the server and the reply of the server that is consisting of a list of new commands are transmitted over the 4G cellular network. Finally, the commands are received by the microcontroller and the changes are applied to the converter. The concept of control is shown in figure \ref{fig:concept3}.

\section{Layers and components}
\label{sec:layers}

The proposed system is composed of five layers separated by responsibilities. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Storage Layer
\item Server Layer
\item Relay Layer
\item Simulation Layer
\item Sensing Layer
\end{itemize}

The storage layer is responsible for storing the state of the server and sensing data received from the microcontrollers. The server layer is where the data processing logic, system monitoring, and data visualisation services are located. The relay layer contains the 4G infrastructures and providing internet access to 4G enabled devices. The sensing layer is responsible for measuring the data and control the generation of power. Lastly, the simulation layer is used to simulate the behaviours of the sensing layer for benchmarking purposes. Figure \ref{fig:concept2} shows the layers and the components within each layer.

\end{figure}

\section{Responsibilities}
\label{sec:responsibilities}

In this section, the responsibilities of each component are described.

\subsection{Storage layer}

\subsubsection{On-disk database}

The distinguishing characteristic of this type of database is the data that is stored in the database is persistent, which means the data remain intact even if the database is down due to failures. It is usually used to store a large amount of data reliably. The downside of using an on-disk database is the response time of querying and inserting data into the database can be very slow. The primary usage in the proposed system is storing the information, status, and sensing data of a device such as a solar panel persistently.

\subsubsection{In-memory database}

The goal for this type of database is not storing the data persistently but aiming to access, modify, and insert data as quick as possible. This advantage is the result of using the memory instead of the disk of the server, which is significantly faster. However, it also comes with the problem of having a significantly smaller capacity, and the data is volatile. That is, the data is gone when the database is down and the data may be purged if the memory of the server is running low. This is primarily used to synchronise the state and sharing data between backend instances that are running on the same server.

\subsection{Server layer}

\subsubsection{Backend}

Backend is a stateless HTTP server and its responsibilities are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Providing application programming interface (API) for microcontrollers to register itself, insert sensing data to the database, and retrieve issued commands.
\item Providing API for the frontend to retrieve data for visualisation and notifying a command had been issued.
\item Providing context-aware load balancing for frontend's real-time data visualisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Frontend}

The frontend is a web application and its responsibilities are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Providing a pleasant and usable user interface.
\item Providing real-time data visualisation.
\item Providing a control panel for issuing commands.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Load balancer}

It is a piece of software that distribute the incoming requests to the server instance with the least amount of load. It also uses multiple threads to serve the frontend web pages to improve the performance under load.

\subsubsection{Governor}

The governors are daemons for housekeeping. That is, they are processes that are running in the background of the server and performing some predefined tasks periodically. There is only one governor in the proposed system, its called the data aggregation governor and its job is aggregating the real-time data every minute.

\subsubsection{Message queue}

This is an asynchronous communication system between the components of the server layer. The main contribution of the message queue is enabling processes such as backend, governor, and data distributor to communicate with each other despite they are completely separate programs.

The message queue is asynchronous because the originating process can send a message and continue to perform other tasks without waiting for the message to arrive or a reply is received. As oppose to synchronous communication, where the originating process would stop doing any work and waiting for a reply to receive before continuing.

\subsubsection{Async job queue and worker}

The asynchronous job queue is a queue of tasks to be executed in a first in first out fashion, and the worker is a thread that takes a job from the queue in order and executes them. The backend is using this mechanism to process lengthy but not time-sensitive tasks such as inserting data into the database to improve performance. Similar to the message queue, the originating process adds a job to the queue and it continues to perform other work without waiting for the work to finish.

\subsubsection{Socket}

The socket is the key to efficient real-time communication between the backend and the frontend. This is the enabling technology which allows the frontend to wait for new data to be available as opposed to letting the clients asking for new data every second, which is very inefficient.

\subsubsection{Data distributor}

The data distributor sits between the clients and the backend during the real-time communication. Its purpose is reducing the load of the server by publishing the data to the relevant clients directly.

Without the data distributor, the clients would be notified when a new data is available, and all clients would query the backend for the same piece of data, causing the backend to be accessed directly proportional to the number of clients. By using the data distributor, the data is distributed directly to the clients and no backend access is needed. Note that the data distributor also knows what data each client want and only distribute the data to the clients interested in the data.

\subsection{Relay layer}

This layer contains two key infrastructures, the 4G base station, and the internet gateway. The 4G base station allows 4G enabled devices to communicate with it and forward the data to its internet gateway so that devices can access the internet wirelessly.

\subsection{Sensing layer}

This layer contains power generation devices such as solar panels, power converters, and batteries in our experimental setup. There are also monitoring devices such as sensors that are attached to the input and output of the converter and send analogue signals to the microcontroller. Then, the microcontroller process those signals and send the data to the server over the 4G cellular network using the 4G modem.

\subsection{Simulation layer}

This layer is used for benchmarking as it can generate any number of virtual solar panels and push simulated data to the server. This enables the performance and characteristics of the system to be measured and this layer should behave identically to the sensing layer from the server layer's point of view.
