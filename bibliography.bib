abstract = "For grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, monitoring is considered as a crucial aspect for observing the stability and performance of the system. The simplest method is to have the data collected and transmitted across data cables. Due to the cost and technical limitations of the data cable, the monitoring station needs to be located reasonably close to the monitored plant. Apart being inconvenient, the use of data cable often adds capital and maintenance cost to the system. In this research project, a Zigbee-based wireless monitoring system is developed for online monitoring of a grid-connected photovoltaic system. Parameters like temperature, irradiation, PV power output and grid inverter power output are monitored. The implementation process, including design and development of the hardware and software, is explained in detail. A user-friendly web-application is also developed, such that the monitored data is easily accessible via internet. To validate the performance, the system has been implemented on 1.25kWp grid-connected photovoltaic system."

abstract = {<p>The use of of single power solar system in generation of electricity for streetlights nowadays is widely used. Generally, many of this kind of streetlight is using one solar panel system to power its lamp. The problem that can be arise for this kind of streetlight is how to control and guarantee the optimal system [1]. The use of ACS712 current sensor and voltage sensor using voltage divider circuit with GSM communication system allows to monitor [2] both the battery and the solar panel. The information from the current sensor and voltage sensor then processed by a microcontroller. This microcontroller then send the data through a GSM communication system to a server, via short message service (SMS). This server then processed the data by parsing the information from the SMS, and send the data to a web server database. This information then can be accessed by internet. The expected outcome of this monitoring system is a system that can be used in monitoring small solar power plants system as the street lights.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Using the Internet Of Things Technology for supervising solar photovoltaic power generation can greatly enhance the performance, monitoring and maintenance of the plant. With advancement of technologies the cost of renewable energy equipments is going down globally encouraging large scale solar photovoltaic installations. This massive scale of solar photovoltaic deployment requires sophisticated systems for automation of the plant monitoring remotely using web based interfaces as majority of them are installed in inaccessible locations and thus unable to be monitored from a dedicated location. The discussion in this paper is based on implementation of new cost effective methodology based on IoT to remotely monitor a solar photovoltaic plant for performance evaluation. This will facilitate preventive maintenance, fault detection, historical analysis of the plant in addition to real time monitoring.</p>},

This chapter explains how gateways work in ZigBee, and describes some common pitfalls when deploying them in the field. A ZigBee gateway is a means of transferring data between a ZigBee network and devices on another network. One simple application of a gateway that interacts with ZigBee is the automatic printing of a list each morning of all the battery-operated ZigBee devices with low battery charge. For a large network, with many thousands of nodes, this can be a huge time and cost-saver for the maintenance personnel. The ZigBee Alliance is continuing to improve the technology, but gateways have not yet been standardized. The advantage of Island Controller technique is that very few routes are needed to support very large networks from a single gateway. The disadvantage is that a human must plan the network and determine which nodes will be Island Controllers. Planning of this nature typically takes place in commercial buildings. Another disadvantage is that the receiving node can't tell who sent the packet, as the packet appears to come from the last Island Controller. Commissioning can make sure the data is sent to the proper gateway. 2.4 GHz 802.15.4 radios communicate at 250 kbps (kilobits per second). This is considered the maximum bandwidth of any given radio. For determining average bandwidth available for applications, one needs to consider the interferers, density of the network, ZigBee protocol overhead, and communication patterns."

abstract = "Wireless sensing is an excellent approach for remotely operated solar power system. Not only being able to get the sensor data, such as voltage, current, and temperature, the system can also have a proper control for tracking the Sun and sensing real-time data from a controller. In order to absorb the maximum energy by solar cells, it needs to track the Sun with proper angles. Arduino, H-bridge motor driver circuit, and Direct Current (DC) motor are used to alter the tilt angle of the solar PhotoVoltaic (PV) panel following the Sun while the azimuth and the elevation angles are fixed at noon. Unlike the traditional way, the tilt rotation is proposed to be stepped hourly. The solar PV panel is tilted 7.5âˆ˜ in advance of current time to the west to produce more output voltage during an hour. As a result, the system is simple while providing good solar-tracking results and efficient power outputs."
