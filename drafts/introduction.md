### Topic

Integrate cloud infrastructures and cellular communication with digital power systems.

Power Systems Monitoring

System Architecture

### Context

The rise of internet of things in the recent years had been pushing the integration of cellular communication capabilities into many areas that we had never thought would be possible.

The cost of cellular communication module has decreased while the speed, bandwidth, and load capacity had increased significantly. 

Cloud infrastructures such as Amazon Web Service, Google Compute Platform and other cloud infrastructure providers had been dominating the market due to their low cost, highly scalable, and highly reliable cloud services making many ideas possible at a much lower cost and technical difficulties. 

Reliability of software offered by the Open source community

Now is a good time to investigate the feasibility, performance, and the extend of such a power system monitoring system that take advantage of cloud infrastructures and cellular technology. 

Power systems are getting increasingly larger, monitoring the panels may take advantage of the coverage of cellular communication and the bandwidth.

### Focus and Scope

Propose a power system monitoring system utilising cellular infrastructure to communicate with the servers hosting on the cloud services.

Achieve remote monitoring, controlling, and viewing real-time information through a web application. 

Studying its feasibility, scalability and performance.

### Relevance and Importance

Barely any information is available on digital power systems monitoring system because they are usually proprietary.

Among the information that is available, barely any work had been done on using the cellular technology, nor there are detailed documentation with regards to the feasibility, the performance, the potential architecture of the system, and using the modern frameworks and cloud infrastructures. 

State of the art:

Physical Link connecting the panels and the monitoring system. 

Wifi between panels and monitoring system. 

Bluetooth between panels and monitoring system.

Provide a reference of a barebone power system monitoring system using cellular technology, modern framework, and cloud infrastructures. 

### Questions and Objectives
